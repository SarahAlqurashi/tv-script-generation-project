# TV Script Generation Project
The aim of this project was to practice with Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this project, a neural network was created to generate a new Seinfeld script. The network created was a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using PyTorch's  with Long Short term memory (LSTM) cells.
